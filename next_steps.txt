Okay so now I have a blog website that runs on my local server and within each session, can add and load posts. However,
I want to now shift it to a heroku server and attach a MongoDB database to it so that I can actually share it with others.

Here are the approximate steps I need to take:

- (DONE)Add a compose button on the home page so that I can directly go to the compose page without having to type in the url
- (DONE)Connect to my MongoDB Atlas cluster and create a new database for my blog
- (DONE)The schema for this blog will essentially be "title" "date" and "content"
- The home page will access this database and populate all the current entries according to date
- (DONE)The compose page will take the input from the form and insert it into the database


Let's do this!
