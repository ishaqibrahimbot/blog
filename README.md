# Ishaq's Blog

Access at: https://ishaq-blog.herokuapp.com/

## Disclaimer
At the moment you will only find random gibberish and testing material there.

## However
I [will] write posts about:

* New things I've learned (in tech or otherwise)
* Interesting experiences I've had
* Results of my experiments with various tech tools

## Another Note
At the moment, anyone visiting this blog can use the 'Compose' link and add a post. That is (obviously)
not the intended functionality of this blog and is only there so that people can add posts and see for themselves that MongoDB is storing everything. In the future, I will fix this issue so that only I can insert
blog posts and others can only read them.

Until I do that, feel free to play around and add your own posts to the blog :)
